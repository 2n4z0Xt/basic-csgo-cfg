> A simple [autoexec.cfg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lythed/basic-csgo-cfg/master/autoexec.cfg) that I use. Feel free to use it :)

I've been using it for a while, I've updated it and decided to put it in public. :)
The CFG is simple, it holds in one file and no need for more for my use. btw you can change the cfg as you like. 👍

## Installation

Download and place the `autoexec.cfg` in your `\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg` folder.

To execute the cfg, open your in-game console and type `exec autoexec`.

(You can add `+exec autoexec` to your CS:GO launch options to execute automatically the cfg.)

⚠️ If you launch the autoexec.cfg, your config will be replaced with the new one. Take a backup if needed!
